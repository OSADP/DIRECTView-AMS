Open Source Overview
============================
DIRECTView AMS consist of the source-code for a visualization module developed as part of the DIRECT simulation software package by the AMS (Analysis, Modeling and Simulation Testbeds for DMA and ATDM Evaluation) Dallas Testbed and enables users to visualize the simulation-based measures of effectiveness as a function of different simulation scenarios. The application reads data from XML based simulation output and is coded in C-sharp. The codebase for DIRECTView is developed by Southern Methodist University. DIRECT stands for Dynamic Intermodal Routing Environment for Control and Telematics.

For further details on the applications, users are encouraged to read the following FHWA documents:
